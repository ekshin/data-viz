##Issues
- Level of analysis: who gets detected more vs. which network gets detected more
- How to measure core in observed network: Freezed degree vs. non constraint degree 

___
##OBSERVED DATA EXAMPLE  

In the following network graphic, detected people are colored in black over the PGK network of the year of 1919.   

```{r}
att<-read.csv("attributes.csv", header=T)
pgk<-read.csv("pgk1919Nodes.csv", header=T)
pgk1919<- as.matrix(read.table("pgk1919.txt"))
names(att)
```
Non-structural/network varaiables in the attribute files are `HOME`, `GENTER`, `KILLED`, `ARREDTED`, `EVENTYEAR`. `HOME` variable describes member's hometwon origin and `EVENTYEAR` variable includes the time of being detected execusion. `EXECUTED` variable is calculated as dummy of the union of `KILLED`  and  `ARREDTED` ignoring the time of being detected.  

```{r eval=FALSE}
p1919<-network(pgk1919, directed=F)
att$detected<-as.numeric(att$eventyear==1919)
kill<-att[,12]
gplot(p1919, displaylabels=F, arrow=F, vertex.col=kill, displayisolates=FALSE)
```
     

**Network attributes of the PGK 1919 network** are described in the following table, with 140 non-isolated nodes.


Network attributes|Value
------------------|----------
 vertices         | 414
 directed         | FALSE
 hyper            | FALSE
 loops            | FALSE
 multiple         | FALSE
 bipartite        | FALSE
 density          | 0.00936

Degree distribution of the PGK 1919 network is presnted in the following graphic. As isolates are not considered, the Min. is 1 and the Max. is 34 with Mean of 5.114 and Median of 3.00.
